<p><font size="2">Early in 2000, as they were working on the first Nashville
Swing Band CD, Buddy and his partner, Jim Peters, figured it would be helpful if
they had their own recording facility.&nbsp; &quot;Buddy works a musician's
hours, and getting him into the studio at times convenient to all the others
involved, was quite a challenge,&quot; Jim explains.&nbsp; Better to take the
studio to Buddy.</font></p>
<p><font size="1"><span style="left: 178; top: 699; position: relative"><img border="0" src="images/blu-buddy.jpg" width="128" height="191" align="right" hspace="15"></span></font><font size="2">Buddy
insisted on achieving a classic quality of recorded&nbsp; sound,
so they sought the experienced engineering help of his son, Matt Spicher and Kurt
Storey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt has years of experience as engineer for Johnny Cash,
Marty Stuart, and Pam Tillis.&nbsp; Kurt has worked with scores of Nashville
artists, including the great fiddler Mark O'Connor, Bluegrass legend Bill
Monroe,&nbsp; and more recently the Grammy nominee, Victor Wooten.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
2000, Buddy's son David has &quot; honed his chops&quot; as a producer and
engineer, and has produced almost a dozen albums at The Fiddle House.&nbsp; Both
David and Matt have &quot;mirror&quot; studios in their homes, allowing them
fantastic flexibility to work on projects in between live engagements.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/fpfiddle.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" hspace="16" vspace="10"></p>
<p><font size="2">Kurt and Buddy came up with the studio name &quot;The Fiddle
House&quot; after completing the CD, &quot;Front Porch Fiddle&quot;; the first
album completely tracked, mixed, and mastered in the studio.&nbsp; Kurt
was so pleased with the sound he was getting that he began bringing in other
clients.&nbsp; Word got out around Nashville, and soon Buddy was being
approached by a wide variety of artist-friends, who loved the sound that was
coming from The Fiddle House.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&quot;The Fiddle House&quot;&nbsp; has been very busy
lately with the production and mixing of several fantastic aritists.&nbsp; Nashville&nbsp;
&quot;Super- engineer&quot;, Kurt Storey has been working with Ginger Boatwright,
Kathy Ciavola, Larry Perkins, and <a href="http://www.compassrecords.com/wooten.htm">Victor
Wooten</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Buddy also appeared on Victor's Grammy Nominated &quot;Yin
Yang&quot; double album, which Kurt engineered, mixed and mastered.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">Kurt recently recorded the incredibly talented
Billy Contreras performing six of his own original jazz compositions.&nbsp; Last
year Billy was selected for the Kennedy Center's&nbsp; symposium in jazz
composition in Washington DC.&nbsp; These recordings serve as &quot;working
essays&quot; for this year's program.&nbsp; Its great stuff, and hopefully Billy
will release a CD of his original music.&nbsp; Billy performs with Buddy and The
Nashville Swing Band every chance he gets.&nbsp; His &quot;new job&quot; as a
freshman at the University of Miami, (Jazz Studies Program) keeps him away from
Nashville, but big things are brewing for this young man.&nbsp; We're really
happy to have him play twin fiddles with Buddy on the CDs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In addition, Buddy's&nbsp; new Nashville Swing
Band albums, he just
finished producing an album with his long time friend from Kentucky, Bill Griffith, that
includes an eclectic selection of Bluegrass and fiddle tunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
great bluegrass dobro player, Josh Graves appears with Bill and Buddy on that
recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">David Spicher has been producing CDs for a couple &quot;Fiddle
House&quot; projects, including a Rockabilly group wonderfully named &quot;The
Dashboard Hula Girls&quot;, and the popular Nashville jazz trio, &quot;The Gypsy
Hombres&quot;, with whom David has performed on bass, including a remix of their
Christmas CD, &quot;Django Bells&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; David has also
recently toured with the highly acclaimed trio &quot;Nickel Creek&quot;, and
tours often with Pam Tillis and Crystal Gayle.</font></p>
