Wheeling, West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there he went to work with some of the
great country show bands including Judy Lynn's noted western swing aggregation
in Las Vegas and Tahoe prior to making Nashville his home in 1958.&nbsp; Having
been aptly called &quot;the Jascha Heifetz of the country fiddle,&quot;&nbsp;
Buddy's genius for arrangements and harmony&nbsp; made him a favorite with
Nashville record producers, while his state-of-the-art perfection with gutsy,
straightforward solo work established him in the role model of America's
best-known quintessential country fiddle player.&nbsp; His confidence and
professionalism belies a gentle nature and extreme modesty; traits which have
won him many friends among a legion of
fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of &quot;Music City's&quot; most in-demand studio musicians for three
decades, Buddy's versatile, precision fiddle style has made enormous
contributions to the commercial success of classic earlier recordings by Webb
Pierce, Ray Price; Bill Monroe;, Kitty Wells; Jimmy Martin and Hank Snow, as
well as those of Bob Wills; The Lewis Family; George Strait; Linda Ronstadt;
Hank Thompson; Henry Mancini; Bob Dylan; The Rolling Stones; Dan Fogelberg;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.crystalgayle.com">Crystal Gayle</a>, The Osborne Brothers,
and Garth Brooks, to name a few of the countless artists with whom he as worked
on diverse album and single record projects.&nbsp; When you hear that familiar
velvet smooth fiddle in George Strait's, &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot;, you
experience the lonesome emotion of the song as Buddy's heartfelt solo expresses
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddy appeared with Mark O'Connor on his&nbsp;
&quot;Heroes&quot; album, a collection of performances by Mark and his favorite
fiddle players.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with his imaginative arrangements, Buddy is well known as being a
master of &quot;double stops&quot;, i.e. playing two notes at the same time and literally
harmonizing with himself.&nbsp; In his&nbsp; performances he plays harmonized
lines and solos that most people couldn't imagine playing with two fiddlers, yet
he seems to do it effortlessly.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you watch and hear Buddy play
with The Nashville Swing Band, its hard to imagine how that much beautiful sound
comes from a single fiddle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">There is a wonderful interview with Buddy that was conducted by Jim Christian
for <a href="http://www.fiddle.com">Fiddler Magazine</a>, in the Fall 1998
issue.&nbsp; The interview took place at a recent <a href="http://www.markoconnor.com/camp.htm">Mark
O'Connor Fiddle Camp</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives much more of his
background, influences and details of his career.&nbsp; An excerpt.....</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">&quot;My new love is jazz because there's nowhere for me to go in my own
  mind anyway, because country fiddle, to me, actually doesn't exist
  anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bluegrass fiddle played with a rock and roll band
  which is the new country.&nbsp; Bluegrass fiddle actually works better because
  it is closely associated with rock and roll because of the same type of
  licks.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you listen to a rock and roll guitar, that's what
  they're playing.&nbsp; So when I'm on a session I'll play all my bluegrass
  licks to match what the guitar is doing.&nbsp; But&nbsp; there's so many great
  bluegrass fiddle players, and rather&nbsp; than try to compete with them, it's
  more a wide open field of&nbsp; trying to be a poor man's Stephane Grappelli
  or Joe Venuti.&nbsp; For one thing they play the kind of tunes that I like
  better, like &quot;After You've Gone&quot; and &quot;Lady Be Good.&quot;&nbsp;
  Those tunes are a lot of fun to play because you're going through a lot of
  chords.&quot;</font></p>
